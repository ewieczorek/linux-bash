This is a basic unix shell created in c. In order to run the shell on your computer download the repository and run the makefile. 

Basic shell commands all work:
pwd, cd, pid, ppid, set, get exit.
As well as anythign you would like to run on your computer. You can run anything in your path just by typing the name of the program followed by any arguments required by the program. 

This shell also allows you to run programs in the background by including an ampersand "&" at the end of your statement. 

I uploaded this shell to github using this shell.
